# CodeChixExercises

This project contains the notebooks from the April 21st Basics of ML Workshop. 

To run them, you will need a working version of python with the following packages installed:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter

All of the necessary software comes standard with Anaconda, available for Windows, Linux, and OS/X: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Alternatively, you may use the VMWare or  VirtualBox images we will circulate on a USB stick.
