# CodeChixExercises

This project contains the notebooks from the April 21st Basics of ML Workshop. 

To run them, you will need a working version of python with the following packages installed:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter

All of the necessary software comes standard with Anaconda, available for Windows, Linux, and OS/X: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Alternatively, you may use VMWare or VirtualBox with the provided images we will circulate on a USB stick. If the internet connection is good enough, you may also download the virtual appliance from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2tje5hiluaqvy23/AAAAz4Rl5Rc0g5O28k4KbAPJa?dl=0

In dropbox, select a direct download of the appliance (we recommend the smaller Knoppix-based one), you can import it into VMWare or VirtualBox.

* In VirtualBox: File -> Import Appliance -> Select the file -> Continue -> Import -> When it's done hit Start
* In VMWare Fusion: File -> Import -> Choose File -> Continue -> Save (Retry As Necessary) -> When it's done hit Start Up

From within the VM: Open a terminal -> go to the Exercises directory -> run "jupyter notebook"
